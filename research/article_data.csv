12,Wilms' tumor 1 gene in hematopoietic malignancies: clinical implications and future directions,"The Wilms' tumor 1 (WT1) gene is an important regulatory molecule that plays a vital role in cell growth and development. Initially, knowledge of WT1 was mostly limited to Wilms' tumor. Over the past years, numerous studies have shown that WT1 is aberrant expressed or mutated in hematopoietic malignancies, including acute leukemia (AL), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Currently, many studies focus on exploring the role of WT1 in hematopoietic malignancies. Such studies improve the understanding of hematopoietic malignancies, and the collection of data about WT1 expression or mutation in hematopoietic malignancies over the past years can facilitate the risk stratification of hematopoietic malignancies. In this review, we highlight the important role of WT1 in hematopoietic malignancies, discuss its potential clinical applications as a minimal residual disease (MRD) and prognostic biomarker, and evaluate the possible therapy target of WT1 in hematopoietic malignancies.","['1 Department of Hematology, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.', '2 Department of Clinical Laboratory, the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou, China.', '3 Department of Clinical Laboratory Medicine & Center for Gene Diagnosis, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan, China.']","Ping Luo, Wei Jing, Kezhen Yi, Sanyun Wu, Fuling Zhou, ",Leukemia & lymphoma,NO_DATE,AML; Hematopoietic malignancies; MDS; MRD; WT1.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32401109
13,Mutation-enhanced international prognostic systems for essential thrombocythaemia and polycythaemia vera,"Survival prediction in essential thrombocythaemia (ET) and polycythaemia vera (PV) is currently based on clinically-derived variables; we examined the possibility of integrating genetic information for predicting survival. To this end, 906 molecularly-annotated patients (416 Mayo Clinic; 490 University of Florence, Italy), including 502 ET and 404 PV, were recruited. Multivariable analysis identified spliceosome mutations to adversely affect overall (SF3B1, SRSF2 in ET and SRSF2 in PV) and myelofibrosis-free (U2AF1, SF3B1 in ET) survival; TP53 mutations predicted leukaemic transformation in ET; ""adverse"" mutations occurred in 51 (10%) ET and 8 (2%) PV patients. We confirmed the independent survival effect of adverse mutations [hazard ratio (HR) 2·4, 95% CI 1·6-3·5], age >60 years (6·6, 4·6-9·7), male sex (1·8, 1·3-2·4) and leukocytosis ≥11 × 109 /l (1·6, 1·1-2·2), in ET, and adverse mutations (7·8, 3·1-17·0), age >67 years (5·4, 3·6-8·1), leukocytosis ≥15 × 109 /l (2·8, 1·8-4·2) and thrombosis history (2·0, 1·4-2·9), in PV. HR-based risk point allocation allowed development of three-tiered mutation-enhanced international prognostic systems (MIPSS) which were validated in both cohorts and performance was shown to be superior to conventional scoring systems. Spliceosome mutations enhance survival prediction in ET and PV and identify patients at risk for fibrotic progression. TP53 mutations predict leukaemic transformation in ET.","['1 Division of Hematology, Departments of Internal Medicine and Laboratory Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', '2 Department of Experimental and Clinical Medicine, CRIMM, Center of Research and Innovation of Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, Azienda Ospedaliera Universitaria Careggi, University of Florence, and Denothe Excellence Center, Florence, Italy.', '3 Division of Hematopathology, Departments of Internal Medicine and Laboratory Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.', '4 Division of Laboratory Genetics and Genomics, Departments of Internal Medicine and Laboratory Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, USA.']","Ayalew Tefferi, Paola Guglielmelli, Terra L Lasho, Giacomo Coltro, Christy M Finke, Giuseppe G Loscocco, Benedetta Sordi, Natasha Szuber, Giada Rotunno, Annalisa Pacilli, Curtis A Hanson, Rhett P Ketterling, Animesh Pardanani, Naseema Gangat, Alessandro M Vannucchi, ",British journal of haematology,NO_DATE,karyotype; leukemia; mutation; myelofibrosis; prognosis; survival.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31945802

15,WT1 Disorder,"Clinical characteristics:
        
WT1 disorder is characterized by congenital/infantile or childhood onset of steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS), a progressive glomerulopathy that does not respond to standard steroid therapy. Additional common findings can include disorders of testicular development (with or without abnormalities of the external genitalia and/or müllerian structures) and Wilms tumor. Less common findings are congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) and gonadoblastoma. While various combinations of renal and other findings associated with a WT1 pathogenic variant were designated as certain syndromes in the past, those designations are now recognized to be part of a phenotypic continuum and are no longer clinically helpful. Diagnosis/testing:
        
      
      The diagnosis of a WT1 disorder is established in a proband with suggestive clinical findings and a heterozygous pathogenic variant in WT1 identified by molecular genetic testing. Management:
        
Treatment of manifestations: SRNS: Avoid immunosuppressants; consider renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) inhibition. Disorder of testicular development: Management is often by a multidisciplinary team (medical geneticist, endocrinologist, urologist, and psychologist). Treat Wilms tumor with standard oncology protocols and, when applicable, nephron-sparing surgery. Treat CAKUT as per standard care. Prevent whenever possible gonadoblastoma by prophylactic gonadectomy. Surveillance: Monitor for first appearance of the following: (1) proteinuria every six months until age ten years, yearly thereafter; (2) Wilms tumor every three months until age seven years. For ongoing issues with disorder of testicular development as per treating multidisciplinary team and for CAKUT as per treating nephrologist and/or urologist. Agents/circumstances to avoid: Avoid treating glomerulopathy with immunosuppressants, as they are not effective and potentially toxic. Evaluation of relatives at risk: It is appropriate to clarify the genetic status of apparently asymptomatic older and younger at-risk relatives of an individual with a WT1 disorder in order to identify as early as possible those who would benefit from prompt initiation of treatment and surveillance. Genetic counseling:
        
WT1 disorder is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Most individuals diagnosed with WT1 disorder have the disorder as the result of an apparent de novo WT1 pathogenic variant; in rare instances, a parent of an individual with WT1 disorder is heterozygous for the WT1 pathogenic variant. If a parent of the proband is affected and/or is known to have the WT1 pathogenic variant identified in the proband, the risk to the sibs of inheriting the WT1 pathogenic variant is 50%. If the proband's WT1 pathogenic variant cannot be detected in the leukocyte DNA of either parent, the recurrence risk to sibs is slightly greater than that of the general population because of the possibility of parental germline mosaicism. Once the WT1 pathogenic variant has been identified in an affected family member, prenatal testing for a pregnancy at increased risk and preimplantation genetic testing are possible.","['1 Centre for Rare Diseases, Clinical Genetics Unit, Department of Biology and Genetics, Medical University of Gdańsk, Gdańsk, Poland']","Beata S Lipska-Ziętkiewicz, ",,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32352694
16,"Primary myelofibrosis: 2021 update on diagnosis, risk-stratification and management","Disease overview:
        
      
      Primary myelofibrosis (PMF) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) characterized by stem cell-derived clonal myeloproliferation that is often but not always accompanied by JAK2, CALR, or MPL mutations. Additional disease features include bone marrow reticulin/collagen fibrosis, aberrant inflammatory cytokine expression, anemia, hepatosplenomegaly, extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH), constitutional symptoms, cachexia, leukemic progression, and shortened survival. Diagnosis:
        
      
      Bone marrow morphology is the primary basis for diagnosis. Presence of JAK2, CALR, or MPL mutation, expected in around 90% of the patients, is supportive but not essential for diagnosis; these mutations are also prevalent in the closely related MPNs, namely polycythemia vera (PV) and essential thrombocythemia (ET). The 2016 World Health Organization classification system distinguishes ""prefibrotic"" from ""overtly fibrotic"" PMF; the former might mimic ET in its presentation. Furthermore, approximately 15% of patients with ET or PV might progress into a PMF-like phenotype (post-ET/PV MF) during their clinical course. Adverse mutations:
        
      
      SRSF2, ASXL1, and U2AF1-Q157 mutations predict inferior survival in PMF, independent of each other and other risk factors. RAS/CBL mutations predicted resistance to ruxolitinib therapy. Adverse karyotype:
        
      
      Very high risk abnormalities include -7, inv (3), i(17q), +21, +19, 12p-, and 11q-. Risk stratification:
        
      
      Two new prognostic systems for PMF have recently been introduced: GIPSS (genetically-inspired prognostic scoring system) and MIPSS70+ version 2.0 (MIPSSv2; mutation- and karyotype-enhanced international prognostic scoring system). GIPSS is based exclusively on mutations and karyotype. MIPSSv2 includes, in addition, clinical risk factors. GIPSS features four and MIPSSv2 five risk categories. Risk-adapted therapy:
        
      
      Observation alone is advised for MIPSSv2 ""low"" and ""very low"" risk disease (estimated 10-year survival 56%-92%); allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (AHSCT) is the preferred treatment for ""very high"" and ""high"" risk disease (estimated 10-year survival 0%-13%); treatment-requiring patients with intermediate-risk disease (estimated 10-year survival 30%) are best served by participating in clinical trials. In non-transplant candidates, conventional treatment for anemia includes androgens, prednisone, thalidomide, and danazol; for symptomatic splenomegaly, hydroxyurea and ruxolitinib; and for constitutional symptoms, ruxolitinib. Fedratinib, another JAK2 inhibitor, has now been FDA-approved for use in ruxolitinib failures. Splenectomy is considered for drug-refractory splenomegaly and involved field radiotherapy for non-hepatosplenic EMH and extremity bone pain. New directions:
        
      
      A number of new agents, alone or in combination with ruxolitinib, are currently under investigation for MF treatment (ClinicalTrials.gov); preliminary results from some of these clinical trials were presented at the 2020 ASH annual meeting and highlighted in the current document.","['1 Division of Hematology, Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, USA.']","Ayalew Tefferi, ",American journal of hematology,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33197049
17,Renal Cell Carcinoma: Molecular Aspects,"Renal cell carcinoma is the most common form of the kidney cancer accounting for more than 85% of the cases of which clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the major histological subtype. The central molecular signature for ccRCC pathogenesis is the biallelic inactivation of VHL gene due to the presence of mutations/hyper-methylation/complete gene loss, which results in the downstream HIF activation. These events lead to increased tyrosine kinase receptor signalling pathways (RAS/MEK/ERK pathway, PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and NF-κB pathway), which through their downstream effector proteins causes the cell to proliferate and migrate. Recent studies have shown that VHL inactivation alone is not sufficient to induce the tumor. Mutations in numerous other genes that codes for chromatin modifiers (PBRM1, SETD2 and BAP1) and signalling proteins (PTEN and mTOR) have been identified along with activation of alternate signalling pathways like STAT and Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) pathway. It has also been shown that STAT pathway also works cooperatively with HIF to enhance the tumor progression. However, SHH pathway reactivation resulted in tumor regardless of the VHL status, indicating the complex nature of the tumor at the molecular level. Therefore, understanding the complete aetiology of ccRCC is important for future therapeutics.","['1 Department of Biochemistry, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Sector 12, Chandigarh, India.']","Aman Kumar, Niti Kumari, Vinny Gupta, Rajendra Prasad, ",Indian journal of clinical biochemistry : IJCB,NO_DATE,Chromatin modifiers; Genomics; Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF); Renal cell carcinoma; Signalling; Von Hippel–Lindau (VHL).,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30072823

19,Epigenetics in myelodysplastic syndromes,"Epigenetic regulators are the largest group of genes mutated in MDS patients. Most mutated genes belong to one of three groups of genes with normal functions in DNA methylation, in H3K27 methylation/acetylation or in H3K4 methylation. Mutations in the majority of epigenetic regulators disrupt their normal function and induce a loss-of-function phenotype. The transcriptional consequences are often failure to repress differentiation programs and upregulation of self-renewal pathways. However, the mechanisms how different epigenetic regulators result in similar transcriptional consequences are not well understood. Hypomethylating agents are active in higher risk MDS patients, but their efficacy does not correlate with mutations in epigenetic regulators and the median duration of hematologic response is limited to 10-13 months. Inhibitors of histone deacetylases (HDAC) yielded disappointing results so far, questioning this approach in MDS patients. We review the clinical relevance of epigenetic mutations in MDS, discuss their functional consequences and highlight the role of epigenetic therapies in this difficult to treat disease.","['1 Department of Hematology, Hemostasis, Oncology and Stem Cell Transplantation, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany.

20,Recent advances in Wilms' tumor predisposition,"Wilms' tumor (WT), the most common childhood kidney cancer, develops in association with an underlying germline predisposition in up to 15% of cases. Germline alterations affecting the WT1 gene and epigenetic alterations affecting the 11p15 locus are associated with a selective increase in WT risk. Nevertheless, WT also occurs in the context of more pleiotropic cancer predispositions, such as DICER1, Li-Fraumeni and Bloom syndrome, as well as Fanconi anemia. Recent germline genomic investigations have increased our understanding of the host genetic factors that influence WT risk, with sequencing of rare familial cases and large WT cohorts revealing an expanding array of predisposition genes and associated genetic conditions. Here, we describe evidence implicating WT1, the 11p15 locus, and the recently identified genes CTR9, REST and TRIM28 in WT predisposition. We discuss the clinical features, mode of inheritance and biological aspects of tumorigenesis, when known. Despite these described associations, many cases of familial WT remain unexplained. Continued investigations are needed to fully elucidate the landscape of germline genetic alterations in children with WT. Establishing a genetic diagnosis is imperative for WT families so that individuals harboring a predisposing germline variant can undergo surveillance, which should enable the early detection of tumors and use of less intensive treatments, thereby leading to improved overall outcomes.","[""1 Department of Oncology, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, TN 38105, USA.""]","Jamie L Maciaszek, Ninad Oak, Kim E Nichols, ",Human molecular genetics,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32412586
21,Targeted Degradation of Oncogenic KRASG12C by VHL-Recruiting PROTACs,"KRAS is mutated in ∼20% of human cancers and is one of the most sought-after targets for pharmacological modulation, despite having historically been considered ""undruggable."" The discovery of potent covalent inhibitors of the KRASG12C mutant in recent years has sparked a new wave of interest in small molecules targeting KRAS. While these inhibitors have shown promise in the clinic, we wanted to explore PROTAC-mediated degradation as a complementary strategy to modulate mutant KRAS. Herein, we report the development of LC-2, the first PROTAC capable of degrading endogenous KRASG12C. LC-2 covalently binds KRASG12C with a MRTX849 warhead and recruits the E3 ligase VHL, inducing rapid and sustained KRASG12C degradation leading to suppression of MAPK signaling in both homozygous and heterozygous KRASG12C cell lines. LC-2 demonstrates that PROTAC-mediated degradation is a viable option for attenuating oncogenic KRAS levels and downstream signaling in cancer cells.","['1 Department of Pharmacology, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut 06511, United States.', '2 Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, Yale University, 260 Whitney Avenue, New Haven, Connecticut 06511, United States.', '3 Department of Chemistry, Yale University, New Haven, Connecticut 06511, United States.']","Michael J Bond, Ling Chu, Dhanusha A Nalawansha, Ke Li, Craig M Crews, ",ACS central science,2020,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32875077
22,Arboviral diseases in pediatrics,"Objectives:
        
      
      To present the currently available evidence on transmission, clinical, diagnostic methods, treatment, and prevention methods of major arboviruses that occur in childhood. Source of data:
        
      
      Non-systematic review carried out in MEDLINE (PubMed), LILACS (VHL), Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane, CAPES Portal, and Google Scholar databases for the past five years using the search terms arboviruses, dengue, chikungunya, Zika, Mayaro, and West Nile fever, as well as child, newborn, and adolescent. Synthesis of data:
        
      
      The main characteristic of arboviruses is the fact that part of their replication cycle occurs inside insect vectors, thus being classically transmitted to humans through the bite of mosquitoes (hematophagous arthropods), although non-vector transmission of these viruses is also possible in specific situations. These diseases remain a major public health challenge, due to the lack of specific antiviral treatment, the co-circulation of different arboviruses in endemic/epidemic regions, the lack of effective and safe immunizations for the vast majority of these viruses, and the great difficulty in vector control, especially in large urban centers. Conclusions:
        
      
      Children are especially vulnerable to this group of diseases due to characteristics that facilitate the development of the most severe forms. More detailed knowledge of this group of diseases allows the pediatrician to diagnose them earlier, implement the correct treatment, monitor warning signs for the most severe forms, and establish effective preventive measures.","['1 Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), Maternidade-Escola, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil.

Over the past 20 years, evolution of PPGL genetics has revealed that around 40% of PPGL are genetically determined, secondary to a germline mutation in one of more than twenty susceptibility genes reported so far. More than half of the mutations occur in one of the SDHx genes (SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, SDHAF2), which encode the different subunits and assembly protein of a mitochondrial enzyme, succinate dehydrogenase. These susceptibility genes predispose to early forms (VHL, RET, SDHD, EPAS1, DLST), syndromic (RET, VHL, EPAS1, NF1, FH), multiple (SDHD, TMEM127, MAX, DLST, MDH2, GOT2) or malignant (SDHB, FH, SLC25A11) PPGL. The discovery of a germline mutation in one of these genes changes the patient's follow-up and allows genetic screening of affected families and the presymptomatic follow-up of relatives carrying a mutation.","['1 Université de Paris, PARCC, INSERM, Equipe Labellisée par la Ligue contre le Cancer, F-75015, Paris, France; Assistance Publique-Hôpitaux de Paris, Hôpital Européen Georges Pompidou, Service de Génétique, F-75015, Paris, France.

24,p53: 800 million years of evolution and 40 years of discovery,"The evolutionarily conserved p53 protein and its cellular pathways mediate tumour suppression through an informed, regulated and integrated set of responses to environmental perturbations resulting in either cellular death or the maintenance of cellular homeostasis. The p53 and MDM2 proteins form a central hub in this pathway that receives stressful inputs via MDM2 and respond via p53 by informing and altering a great many other pathways and functions in the cell. The MDM2-p53 hub is one of the hubs most highly connected to other signalling pathways in the cell, and this may be why TP53 is the most commonly mutated gene in human cancers. Initial or truncal TP53 gene mutations (the first mutations in a stem cell) are selected for early in cancer development inectodermal and mesodermal-derived tissue-specific stem and progenitor cells and then, following additional mutations, produce tumours from those tissue types. In endodermal-derived tissue-specific stem or progenitor cells, TP53 mutations are functionally selected as late mutations transitioning the mutated cell into a malignant tumour. The order in which oncogenes or tumour suppressor genes are functionally selected for in a stem cell impacts the timing and development of a tumour.","['1 Simons Center for Systems Biology, Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton, NJ, USA. alevine@ias.edu.']","Arnold J Levine, ",Nature reviews.

However, the molecular mode of action is highly versatile and ranges from direct transcriptional to post-transcriptional control, which includes RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) as crucial regulators of cell fate. RBPs coordinate RNA dynamics, including subcellular localization, translational efficiency and metabolism, by binding to their target messenger RNAs (mRNAs), thereby controlling the expression of the encoded proteins. In view of the growing interest in these regulators, this review summarizes recent research regarding the most influential RBPs relevant in acute leukemias in particular. The reported RBPs, either dysregulated or as components of fusion proteins, are described with respect to their functional domains, the pathways they affect, and clinical aspects associated with their dysregulation or altered functions.","['1 Department of Pediatrics 1, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, 06120 Halle, Germany.', '2 Institute of Molecular Medicine, Martin Luther University Halle-Wittenberg, 06120 Halle, Germany.']","Konstantin Schuschel, Matthias Helwig, Stefan Hüttelmaier, Dirk Heckl, Jan-Henning Klusmann, Jessica I Hoell, ",International journal of molecular sciences,2020,ALL; AML; CPSF6; IGF2BP; MSI2; RBM15-MKL1; RNA-binding protein; WT1; ZFP36; hematopoiesis; hnRNP K; nucleolin.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32408494

Prevention in these women requires a personalised and multidisciplinary approach. Preventive therapy with selective oestrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) like tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors (AIs) substantially reduces breast cancer risk well beyond the active treatment period. The importance of benign breast disease as a marker of increased breast cancer risk remains underappreciated, and although the benefit of preventive therapy may be greater in such women, preventive therapy remains underutilised in these and other high-risk women. Bilateral Risk-Reducing Mastectomy (BRRM) reduces the risk of developing breast cancer by 90% in high-risk women such as carriers of BRCA mutations. It also improves breast cancer-specific survival in BRCA1 carriers. Bilateral risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy may also reduce risk in premenopausal BRCA2 carriers.

This article reviews the relationship between WT1 and breast cancer from two aspects: (1) clinical application of WT1, including the relationship between expression of WT1 and prognosis of breast cancer patients, and its effectiveness as a target for comprehensive therapy of breast cancer; (2) the biological effects and molecular mechanisms of WT1 in the development and progression of breast cancer, including proliferation, apoptosis, invasion, and metastasis of breast cancer cells.","['1 Breast and Thyroid Surgery, Southwest Hospital, Army Medical University, Chongqing 400038, China.', '2 Breast and Thyroid Surgery, Chongqing General Hospital, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chongqing 400013, China.']","Ye Zhang, Wen-Ting Yan, Ze-Yu Yang, Yan-Ling Li, Xuan-Ni Tan, Jun Jiang, Yi Zhang, Xiao-Wei Qi, ",International journal of biological sciences,2020,WT1; breast neoplasms; carcinogenesis; prognosis.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32210734
29,Von Hippel-Lindau Disease,"Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease is an autosomal dominantly inherited tumor syndrome. The incidence of VHL disease is about one in 36,000 livebirths and the penetrance is higher than 90%. Similar to other tumor suppressor gene disorders, VHL disease is characterized by frequent development of specific types of tumors in selective organs. The disease is named after the German ophthalmologist Eugen von Hippel, who identified and described characteristic retinal manifestations, and the Swedish pathologist Arvid Lindau, who discovered the frequent co-occurrence of retinal and cerebellar hemangioblastoma with tumors and cysts in visceral organs. He described the clinical spectrum of VHL disease in detail in a large series of cases from Sweden but also from other European countries. A clinical classification system divides individuals who are affected by VHL disease into two groups: Those predominantly without pheochromocytoma are classified as VHL type 1, and those predominantly with pheochromocytoma are classified as VHL type 2. VHL type 2 is further subdivided into type 2A (with renal cancer) and type 2B (without renal cancer). In type 2C affected patients develop solely pheochromocytomas. Tumorigenesis in patients with VHL disease shares fundamental principles in the different affected organ systems: germline VHL inactivation leads to persistence of microscopic developmentally arrested structures. These microscopic cell clusters already reveal biallelic VHL inactivation and consequent up-regulation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF) and down-stream targets like VEGF, EPO. Current research for pharmacotherapy of VHL disease targets proteins of the HIF cascade and compounds that lead to upregulation and re-functionalization of mutated VHL protein.

32,Clonal hematopoiesis: Pre-cancer PLUS,"Clonal hematopoiesis is a common, age-related process in which a somatically mutated hematopoietic precursor gives rise to a genetically distinct subpopulation in the blood. This phenomenon has been observed in populations across the globe and, while virtually non-existent in children is estimated to affect >10% of the 70-and-older age group. The mutations are thought to occur in stem cells, which makes them pre-cancerous, and precursors to cancer stem cells. Many of the genes most commonly mutated in clonal hematopoiesis are also recurrently mutated in leukemia, genes such as DNMT3A, TET2, ASXL1, JAK2, and TP53. However, between 40% and 60% of cases arise from the accumulation of what appear to be random mutations outside of known driver genes. Clonal hematopoiesis is frequently present in otherwise healthy individuals and may persist for many years. Though largely asymptomatic, carrying these somatic mutations confers a small but significantly increased risk of leukemic transformation, affecting 0.5-1% carriers per year; although most genes confer an increased risk of transformation, mutations in TP53 and U2AF1 appear to carry a particularly high risk for transformation. Additionally, a patient's history of prior treatment with cytotoxic chemotherapy and/or radiation are correlated with the development of clonal hematopoiesis; in the setting of chemotherapy treatment of solid tumors, hematopoietic mutations in TP53 and PPM1D appear to contribute to outgrowth of clones that may lead to subsequent malignancy. The presence of a clone also imparts a significantly increased risk of cardiovascular disease, which in some cases appears to be due to increased inflammation and atherosclerosis. Clonal hematopoiesis is correlated with several other diseases as well, including diabetes, chronic pulmonary disease, and aplastic anemia, with other associations probably yet to be uncovered.","['1 Medical Scientist Training Program, Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, Nashville, TN, United States.', '2 Department of Pathology, Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States.

33,Olaparib for Metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer,"Background:
        
      
      Multiple loss-of-function alterations in genes that are involved in DNA repair, including homologous recombination repair, are associated with response to poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition in patients with prostate and other cancers. Methods:
        
      
      We conducted a randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial evaluating the PARP inhibitor olaparib in men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had disease progression while receiving a new hormonal agent (e.g., enzalutamide or abiraterone). All the men had a qualifying alteration in prespecified genes with a direct or indirect role in homologous recombination repair. Cohort A (245 patients) had at least one alteration in BRCA1, BRCA2, or ATM; cohort B (142 patients) had alterations in any of 12 other prespecified genes, prospectively and centrally determined from tumor tissue. Patients were randomly assigned (in a 2:1 ratio) to receive olaparib or the physician's choice of enzalutamide or abiraterone (control). The primary end point was imaging-based progression-free survival in cohort A according to blinded independent central review. Results:
        
      
      In cohort A, imaging-based progression-free survival was significantly longer in the olaparib group than in the control group (median, 7.4 months vs. 3.6 months; hazard ratio for progression or death, 0.34; 95% confidence interval, 0.25 to 0.47; P<0.001); a significant benefit was also observed with respect to the confirmed objective response rate and the time to pain progression. The median overall survival in cohort A was 18.5 months in the olaparib group and 15.1 months in the control group; 81% of the patients in the control group who had progression crossed over to receive olaparib. A significant benefit for olaparib was also seen for imaging-based progression-free survival in the overall population (cohorts A and B). Anemia and nausea were the main toxic effects in patients who received olaparib. Conclusions:
        
      
      In men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who had disease progression while receiving enzalutamide or abiraterone and who had alterations in genes with a role in homologous recombination repair, olaparib was associated with longer progression-free survival and better measures of response and patient-reported end points than either enzalutamide or abiraterone.

34,Lessons in PROTAC Design from Selective Degradation with a Promiscuous Warhead,"Inhibiting protein function selectively is a major goal of modern drug discovery. Here, we report a previously understudied benefit of small molecule proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) that recruit E3 ubiquitin ligases to target proteins for their ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-mediated degradation. Using promiscuous CRBN- and VHL-recruiting PROTACs that bind >50 kinases, we show that only a subset of bound targets is degraded. The basis of this selectivity relies on protein-protein interactions between the E3 ubiquitin ligase and the target protein, as illustrated by engaged proteins that are not degraded as a result of unstable ternary complexes with PROTAC-recruited E3 ligases. In contrast, weak PROTAC:target protein affinity can be stabilized by high-affinity target:PROTAC:ligase trimer interactions, leading to efficient degradation. This study highlights design guidelines for generating potent PROTACs as well as possibilities for degrading undruggable proteins immune to traditional small-molecule inhibitors.","['1 Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, Yale University, 219 Prospect Street, New Haven, CT 06511, USA.', '2 Arvinas, LLC, 5 Science Park, New Haven, CT 06511, USA.', '3 Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, Yale University, 219 Prospect Street, New Haven, CT 06511, USA; Departments of Chemistry and Pharmacology, Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA.

35,The BRCA1 and BRCA2 Genes in Early-Onset Breast Cancer Patients,"Approximately 5-10% of breast cancers are attributable to genetic susceptibility. Mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are the best known genetic factors to date. The goal of this study was to determine the structure and distribution of haplotypes of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes in early-onset breast cancer patients. We enrolled 70 patients diagnosed with early-onset breast cancer. A total of 21 SNPs (11 on BRCA1 and 10 on BRCA2) and 1 dinucleotide deletion on BRCA1 were genotyped using nested allele-specific PCR methods. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) analysis was conducted, and haplotypes were deduced from the genotype data. Two tightly linked LD blocks were observed on each of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Variant-free haplotypes (TAT-AG for BRCA1 and ATA-AAT for BRCA2) were observed at a frequency of more than 50% on each gene along with variable frequencies of derived haplotypes. The variant 3'-subhaplotype CGC displayed strong LD with 5'-subhaplotypes GA, AA, and GG on BRCA1 gene. Haplotypes ATA-AGT, ATC-AAT, and ATA-AAC were the variant haplotypes frequent on BRCA2 gene. Although the clinical significance of these derived haplotypes has not yet been established, it is expected that some of these haplotypes, especially the less frequent subhaplotypes, eventually will be shown to be indicative of a predisposition to early-onset breast cancer.","['1 Regenerative Medicine Cluster, Advanced Medical and Dental Institute, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Penang, Malaysia.', '2 Genomix Lab Sdn Bhd, Petaling Jaya, Selangor, Malaysia.', '3 Surgery Department, Seberang Jaya Hospital, Seberang Prai, Malaysia.', '4 Pathology Department, Seberang Jaya Hospital, Seberang Prai, Malaysia.', '5 Oncology and Radiological Sciences Cluster, Advanced Medical and Dental Institute, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Penang, Malaysia.', '6 Surgery Department, School of Medical Sciences, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Kubang Kerian, Kelantan, Malaysia.', '7 Regenerative Medicine Cluster, Advanced Medical and Dental Institute, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Penang, Malaysia. badrul@usm.my.']","Mohamed Saleem, Mohd Bazli Ghazali, Md Azlan Mohamed Abdul Wahab, Narazah Mohd Yusoff, Hakimah Mahsin, Ch'ng Ewe Seng, Imran Abdul Khalid, Mohd Nor Gohar Rahman, Badrul Hisham Yahaya, ",Advances in experimental medicine and biology,NO_DATE,BRCA1; BRCA2; Breast cancer; Early onset.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29687286
36,A selective BCL-XL PROTAC degrader achieves safe and potent antitumor activity,"B-cell lymphoma extra large (BCL-XL) is a well-validated cancer target. However, the on-target and dose-limiting thrombocytopenia limits the use of BCL-XL inhibitors, such as ABT263, as safe and effective anticancer agents. To reduce the toxicity of ABT263, we converted it into DT2216, a BCL-XL proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC), that targets BCL-XL to the Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) E3 ligase for degradation. We found that DT2216 was more potent against various BCL-XL-dependent leukemia and cancer cells but considerably less toxic to platelets than ABT263 in vitro because VHL is poorly expressed in platelets. In vivo, DT2216 effectively inhibits the growth of several xenograft tumors as a single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents, without causing appreciable thrombocytopenia. These findings demonstrate the potential to use PROTAC technology to reduce on-target drug toxicities and rescue the therapeutic potential of previously undruggable targets. Furthermore, DT2216 may be developed as a safe first-in-class anticancer agent targeting BCL-XL.","['1 Department of Pharmacodynamics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', '2 Department of Medicinal Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', '3 Department of Leukemia, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, USA.', '4 Department of Pathology, Immunology and Laboratory Medicine, College of Medicine, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', '5 Department of Pharmaceutics, College of Pharmacy, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA.', '6 Department of Pediatrics, Pathology, Cell Biology and Systems of Biology and Institute for Cancer Genetics, Columbia University, New York, NY, USA.', ""7 Department of Pediatrics, Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Los Angeles, CA, USA."", ""8 Greehey Children's Cancer Research Institute, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA."", '9 Department of Medicine, the Long School of Medicine, University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio, San Antonio, TX, USA.', '10 Department of Medicinal Chemistry, College of Pharmacy, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA. zhengg@cop.ufl.edu.', '11 Department of Pharmacodynamics, University of Florida, Gainesville, FL, USA. zhoudaohong@cop.ufl.edu.']","Sajid Khan, Xuan Zhang, Dongwen Lv, Qi Zhang, Yonghan He, Peiyi Zhang, Xingui Liu, Dinesh Thummuri, Yaxia Yuan, Janet S Wiegand, Jing Pei, Weizhou Zhang, Abhisheak Sharma, Christopher R McCurdy, Vinitha M Kuruvilla, Natalia Baran, Adolfo A Ferrando, Yong-Mi Kim, Anna Rogojina, Peter J Houghton, Guangcun Huang, Robert Hromas, Marina Konopleva, Guangrong Zheng, Daohong Zhou, ",Nature medicine,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31792461
37,Splicing factor mutant myelodysplastic syndromes: Recent advances,"The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are common myeloid malignancies showing frequent progression to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Pre-mRNA splicing is an essential cellular process carried out by the spliceosome. Mutations in splicing factor genes (including SF3B1, SRSF2, U2AF1 and ZRSR2) occur in over half of MDS patients and result in aberrant pre-mRNA splicing of many target genes, implicating aberrant spliceosome function in MDS disease pathogenesis. Recent functional studies have illuminated the impact on hematopoiesis of some aberrantly spliced target genes associated with splicing factor mutations. Emerging data show that the commonly mutated splicing factors have convergent effects on aberrant splicing of mRNAs that promote NF-κB signaling and on R-loop elevation leading to DNA damage, providing novel insights into MDS disease pathophysiology. It is recognized that the survival of splicing factor mutant cells is dependent on the presence of the wildtype allele, providing a rationale for the use of spliceosome inhibitors in splicing factor mutant MDS. Pre-clinical studies involving E7107 and H3B-8800 have shown the potential of these spliceosome inhibitors for the treatment of splicing factor mutant MDS and AML.","['1 Bloodwise Molecular Haematology Unit, Nuffield Division of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford, Oxford BRC Haematology Theme, Oxford, UK.

38,U2AF1 mutations induce oncogenic IRAK4 isoforms and activate innate immune pathways in myeloid malignancies,"Spliceosome mutations are common in myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), but the oncogenic changes due to these mutations have not been identified. Here a global analysis of exon usage in AML samples revealed distinct molecular subsets containing alternative spliced isoforms of inflammatory and immune genes. Interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase 4 (IRAK4) was the dominant alternatively spliced isoform in MDS and AML and is characterized by a longer isoform that retains exon 4, which encodes IRAK4-long (IRAK4-L), a protein that assembles with the myddosome, results in maximal activation of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of B cells (NF-κB) and is essential for leukaemic cell function. Expression of IRAK4-L is mediated by mutant U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 1 (U2AF1) and is associated with oncogenic signalling in MDS and AML. Inhibition of IRAK4-L abrogates leukaemic growth, particularly in AML cells with higher expression of the IRAK4-L isoform. Collectively, mutations in U2AF1 induce expression of therapeutically targetable 'active' IRAK4 isoforms and provide a genetic link to activation of chronic innate immune signalling in MDS and AML.","[""1 Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", '2 Department of Cancer Biology, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', '3 Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY, USA.', '4 Nuffield Division of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford and Oxford BRC Haematology Theme, Oxford, UK.', '5 Department of Medicine, Washington University, St. Louis, MO, USA.', '6 Laboratory of Immune System Biology, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD, USA.', '7 Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', ""8 Division of Biomedical Informatics, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA."", '9 Department of Pediatrics, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, OH, USA.', '10 Nuffield Division of Clinical Laboratory Sciences, Radcliffe Department of Medicine, University of Oxford and Oxford BRC Haematology Theme, Oxford, UK. jacqueline.boultwood@ndcls.ox.ac.uk.', '11 Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Montefiore Medical Center, Bronx, NY, USA. amit.verma@einstein.yu.edu.', ""12 Division of Experimental Hematology and Cancer Biology, Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, Cincinnati, OH, USA.

These observations have led to clinical efforts to directly inhibit the spliceosome in patients with refractory leukemias.

Cancer cells bearing these mutations are preferentially dependent on wild-type (WT) spliceosome function, but clinically relevant means to therapeutically target the spliceosome do not currently exist. Here we describe an orally available modulator of the SF3b complex, H3B-8800, which potently and preferentially kills spliceosome-mutant epithelial and hematologic tumor cells. These killing effects of H3B-8800 are due to its direct interaction with the SF3b complex, as evidenced by loss of H3B-8800 activity in drug-resistant cells bearing mutations in genes encoding SF3b components. Although H3B-8800 modulates WT and mutant spliceosome activity, the preferential killing of spliceosome-mutant cells is due to retention of short, GC-rich introns, which are enriched for genes encoding spliceosome components.

When HCT does produce prolonged relapse-free survival, it commonly reflects graft-versus-leukemia effects mediated by donor T cells reactive with antigens on leukemic cells4. As graft T cells have not been selected for leukemia specificity and frequently recognize proteins expressed by many normal host tissues, graft-versus-leukemia effects are often accompanied by morbidity and mortality from graft-versus-host disease5. Thus, AML relapse risk might be more effectively reduced with T cells expressing receptors (TCRs) that target selected AML antigens6. We therefore isolated a high-affinity Wilms' Tumor Antigen 1-specific TCR (TCRC4) from HLA-A2+ normal donor repertoires, inserted TCRC4 into Epstein-Bar virus-specific donor CD8+ T cells (TTCR-C4) to minimize graft-versus-host disease risk and enhance transferred T cell survival7,8, and infused these cells prophylactically post-HCT into 12 patients ( NCT01640301 ). Relapse-free survival was 100% at a median of 44 months following infusion, while a concurrent comparative group of 88 patients with similar risk AML had 54% relapse-free survival (P = 0.002). TTCR-C4 maintained TCRC4 expression, persisted long-term and were polyfunctional. This strategy appears promising for preventing AML recurrence in individuals at increased risk of post-HCT relapse.","['1 Program in Immunology, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', '2 Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', '3 University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA.', '4 Vaccine and Infectious Disease Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', '5 Public Health Sciences Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', '6 Landspítali Háskólasjúkrahús, Reykjavík, Iceland.', '7 Alpine Biotech, Seattle, WA, USA.', '8 Therapeutic Products Program, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA.', '9 School of Informatics, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, UK.', '10 Program in Immunology, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA. pgreen@u.washington.edu.', '11 Clinical Research Division, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, WA, USA. pgreen@u.washington.edu.', '12 University of Washington School of Medicine, Seattle, WA, USA. pgreen@u.washington.edu.', '13 Departments of Immunology and Medicine, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA. pgreen@u.washington.edu.']","Aude G Chapuis, Daniel N Egan, Merav Bar, Thomas M Schmitt, Megan S McAfee, Kelly G Paulson, Valentin Voillet, Raphael Gottardo, Gunnar B Ragnarsson, Marie Bleakley, Cecilia C Yeung, Petri Muhlhauser, Hieu N Nguyen, Lara A Kropp, Luca Castelli, Felecia Wagener, Daniel Hunter, Marcus Lindberg, Kristen Cohen, Aaron Seese, M Juliana McElrath, Natalie Duerkopp, Ted A Gooley, Philip D Greenberg, ",Nature medicine,NO_DATE,NO_KEYWORDS,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31235963
