A single CaM kinase II site was also identified at serine 744 within sub-kinase domain III, and autokinase activity was significantly affected by mutation of this serine to an aspartic acid making this site appear constitutively phosphorylated.

EGF also induces SCAMP-EGFR association, as detected by coimmunoprecipitation, and phosphorylation of SCAMP3 is stimulated by the EGFR in vitro. These results suggest that phosphorylation of SCAMPs, either directly or indirectly, may be functionally linked to the internalization/down-regulation of the EGFR. we have observed that there are two tyrosines conserved in SCAMP1 and SCAMP3, which are not found in SCAMP2.

EGF also induces SCAMP-EGFR association, as detected by coimmunoprecipitation, and phosphorylation of SCAMP3 is stimulated by the EGFR in vitro. These results suggest that phosphorylation of SCAMPs, either directly or indirectly, may be functionally linked to the internalization/down-regulation of the EGFR. we have observed that there are two tyrosines conserved in SCAMP1 and SCAMP3, which are not found in SCAMP2.

The overall patterns of the phosphopeptide maps generated by these tyrosine kinases were similar, although there were some differences among these maps (Figure 4a–d).We performed phosphopeptide mapping analysis using GST-fused N-Shc protein, and found that N-Shc phosphorylated by TrkA in vitro was resolved into at least seven phosphopeptides (Y1 through Y7, Figure 4a). Phosphopeptide mapping revealed that N-Shc has novel tyrosine-phosphorylation sites at Y259/Y260 and Y286; in vivo-phosphorylation of these tyrosines was demonstrated by site-specific anti-pTyr antibodies. Phosphorylated Y286 bound to several proteins, of which one was Crk. The pY221/pY222 site, corresponding to one of the Grb2-binding sites of Shc, also preferentially bound to Crk.
